  "text": "Identify a wiki you could imagine yourself creating, then write a set of naming conventions for it. These should include:\n\n* How exactly titles should be capitalized, including how acronyms and other weirdnesses will be handled.\n* Whether you use CamelCase titles, and if so, what you do if there's only one word or it otherwise doesn't match the capitalization rules required to create a link.\n* Any special rules that seem appropriate (e.g., names of sources end with their publication date or the word `Source`).\n\nYou can refer to the [[naming conventions for my Zettelkasten|https://zettelkasten.sorenbjornstad.com/#OurNamingConventions]] for an example.",
