  "text": "TiddlyWiki has full support for ''CSS stylesheets'', both inline and as tiddlers. We saw this briefly in [[Creating a List of Links and Backlinks]]. Here are a few more details.\n\nThis section assumes you have basic knowledge of CSS. If you don't, and you would like to learn more about how to style your TiddlyWiki, a variety of good tutorials are available on the web.\n\n!! Inline stylesheets\n\nYou can use a `<style>` element to embed rules within the text of a tiddler. The style section can appear anywhere in the tiddler, but it's common practice to put it at the bottom.\n\nBe careful, however -- inline stylesheets are not scoped to the tiddler! If you place a broad rule such as `p { color: purple; }` in a tiddler, all paragraph text ''anywhere in the wiki'' will become purple whenever that tiddler is open, including in other tiddlers and in the sidebar. For this reason, you should normally use a class name on all rules that you define this way, and make sure your class name is unique so it doesn't accidentally conflict with something used elsewhere in the wiki.\n\nBecause of the lack of scoping, the rules in a given tiddler are guaranteed to apply to any tiddlers that transclude it; we took advantage of this in [[Creating a List of Links and Backlinks]].\n\n!! Styling and classes in wikitext\n\nYou can apply arbitrary styles or classes to regions of wikitext using the `@@` syntax, like this:\n\n{{Sn:AtAtStyle||MagicSnippet}}\n\n{{Sn:AtAtClass||MagicSnippet}}\n\nSee the [[documentation|https://tiddlywiki.com/#Styles%20and%20Classes%20in%20WikiText]] for more on this feature.\n\n\n!! Stylesheets in tiddlers\n\nFor styles and stylesheets you want to use in more than a single template or tiddler, a more robust approach is to place them in ''tiddlers of their own''.\n\nTiddlers tagged `$:/tags/Stylesheet` will be incorporated in the global stylesheet and apply to all tiddlers in the wiki at all times. Any changes to such tiddlers take effect as soon as you save the tiddler.\n\nThere is a content type called `text/css`. This is convenient for stylesheets since it makes nice syntax highlighting when you view the tiddler, but be aware that choosing this content type takes away the ability you would otherwise have to use transclusions or macro calls in your stylesheet. For instance, this is valid if and only if you have the content type of the tiddler set to wikitext:\n\n```css\n.my-alert-class {\n  background-color: <<colour alert-background>>;\n}\n```\n\n!!
