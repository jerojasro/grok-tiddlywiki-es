(You may also have found `$:/temp/search/input`, which is an auxiliary tiddler used for the `keyboard-driven-input` that handles the autocomplete functions of the search box, and often contains the same text.)\n\nThe easiest way to find this answer is to type a weird word in the search box that you won't find anywhere else (e.g., `oobleckblargle`), then open up Advanced Search and search for the same word on the `System` tab. The tiddler will appear in the list."),
