This is a rather cryptic error message, but if you remember what it means, the cause of the error is usually obvious once you start looking.\n\nAs we move forward into [[templates|Templates and the Current Tiddler]], you will sometimes see this error on a template -- in that case, it does not necessarily mean you did anything wrong. More to come.")
