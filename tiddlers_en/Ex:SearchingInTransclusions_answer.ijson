Transcluded content is not actually part of the text field of a tiddler -- TiddlyWiki only shows it there when you look at the tiddler -- so it doesn't show up in search, either.\n\nIf you search for //the transclusion itself// -- like, the part that looks like `{{JaneDoe}}` -- then you //will// find that. (But if you type the braces into the ordinary search bar, it doesn't like special characters and won't find anything. Type just `JaneDoe` and you'll find that any tiddler that transcludes `JaneDoe` shows up.)"),
