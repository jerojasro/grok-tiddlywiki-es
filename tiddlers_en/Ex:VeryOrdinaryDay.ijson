  "text": "The `TodaysHoliday` tiddler has a problem: if today isn't a holiday, it says \"It's today!\". While true, that sounds a little silly, doesn't it? Change the tiddler so that if today is not a holiday, it instead says, \"Sadly, it's a very ordinary day today.\"\n\n//Hint 1//: If you don't remember how to make some wikitext appear only if a condition is met, have another read through [[Text Substitution]].\n\n//Hint 2//: An attribute called `emptyMessage` will come in handy."
