  "text": "Our buttons don't display very nicely:\n\n* They're absolutely gigantic on the toolbar and have text on them instead of an icon.\n* Their shape doesn't match that of the other tiddlers.\n* They don't have tooltips.\n* They don't have a description in the ''Tools'' tab of the sidebar.\n\nCorrect these issues. You'll want to refer to an existing tiddler on the toolbar to see how each of these things is done.\n\n//Tip//: The fastest way to choose an icon from the set that comes with TiddlyWiki is to open the tag manager and pretend to pick an icon from the drop-down. Each icon shows its full tiddler name, so you can then use that name elsewhere.",
