  "text": "Being able to browse by tags and links is nice. For many use cases that's enough, and indeed it's often better not to tie ourselves into trying to organize all of our notes into a single hierarchy. Sometimes, though, we have a cluster of notes about a particular topic that ''naturally forms into a hierarchy'' -- for example, an individual project -- and being able to view that hierarchy in a table of contents is a valuable way to see an overview of the topic. And certain applications of TiddlyWiki, such as writing a book, really do benefit from a hierarchy covering the entire contents of the wiki.\n\nImportant disclaimer: you can only use the built-in table-of-contents functionality with a hierarchy built out of tags, not one built out of fields or links. Fortunately, that's how we chose to do it in our example wiki. The TiddlyWiki Locator [[plugin|Plugins]] is useful if you need more powerful tools, including navigating hierarchies built of fields or links.\n\n\n!! Creating structure tiddlers\n\nLet's look at how we can create a table of contents for our onboarding project. We'll begin by creating some basic structure underneath it. Let's say the project is broadly divided into three parts. We'll need to create a tiddler for each of these parts to define the hierarchy:\n\n* HR stuff about the company and government-mandated training -- `OnboardingHr`\n* Introductions and social events/notes -- `OnboardingPeople`\n* Training for the position -- `OnboardingTraining`\n\nGo ahead and create those three tiddlers and tag them `OnboardingProcess`, thus marking them as direct members of the idea `OnboardingProcess`. Rather than create new tiddlers and tag them manually, here's a handy timesaver: click the more drop-down <<textual-button \"down-arrow\">> on the `OnboardingProcess` tiddler and choose <<textual-button \"new-here-button\">> //New here//. A new tiddler will open, already tagged `OnboardingProcess`.\n\nThere's no need to put any content in the tiddlers for the time being. If we later find we need to give an overview of that part of the onboarding process, or we have information about it that doesn't seem to deserve its own tiddler, we can add it at that time.\n\n!! Creating the table of contents\n\nThe most basic table of contents is created with the wikitext `<<toc \"Root\">>`, where `Root` is the name of the tiddler you want the table of contents to start at. In our case, this will be:\n\n```html\n<<toc \"OnboardingProcess\">>\n```\n\nThe funny double angle brackets `<<>>` introduce a reference to a variable or a macro call. You don't need to worry about what those are for now; we'll learn a whole lot more about them in [[Chapter 4|Variables, Macros, and Transclusions]].\n\nGo ahead and edit the `OnboardingProcess` tiddler and drop that snippet in. You'll see that a numbered list of the items tagged `OnboardingProcess` shows up. But oops, the `EmployeeProfileSetupMeeting` probably doesn't belong at the top level now that we've added our three subparts of the onboarding project. It makes more sense to have it in `OnboardingHr`, agreed? Let's open the `EmployeeProfileSetupMeeting`, remove the `OnboardingProcess` tag, and add the `OnboardingHr` tag. If we save it and go back up to `OnboardingProcess` now, we'll see that now it's indented into a second level.\n\nThis is great, but what happens if we have a project tiddler that has dozens of tiddlers in it? This list is going to get long really fast! Try changing the code to this:\n\n```html\n<<toc-expandable \"OnboardingProcess\">>\n```\n\nYou'll see that only the topmost level of the hierarchy is displayed now, and little chevrons <<textual-button \"right-arrow\">> appear next to the items. If you click the chevron by `OnboardingHr`, it turns to point down <<textual-button \"down-arrow\">> and the next level shows up.\n\nBut wait\u2026why are there chevrons next to `OnboardingPeople` and `OnboardingTraining`? Those don't have any content yet! If you click on one of them, you'll see that the chevron changes direction but nothing else happens. That's irritating, isn't it?\n\nAll right, third time's the charm:\n\n```html\n<<toc-selective-expandable \"OnboardingProcess\">>\n```\n\nAh, that's better! (If only it were so easy to solve annoying behavior in all of tech.) Now the chevrons only show up by the elements that can actually be expanded.\n\n\n!! Ordering items\n\nYou might be wondering whether we can change the order of the items under each branch of the table of contents. TiddlyWiki has a general mechanism for ordering the tiddlers of a particular tag, and this order, once established, will be respected in many places, including tables of contents. We'll learn about this mechanism in the next section, [[Ordering Tiddlers]].\n\n\n!!
