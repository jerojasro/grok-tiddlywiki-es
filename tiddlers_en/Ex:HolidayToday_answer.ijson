  "text": "The easiest and cleanest way uses the [[transclude widget|https://tiddlywiki.com/#TranscludeWidget]] with the `index` attribute to get a property from a data tiddler:\n\n```html\nIt's ''<$transclude tiddler=UsHolidays index=<<now \"0MM/0DD\">> />'' today!\n```\n\nHowever, we didn't discuss the `transclude` widget, so it's unlikely you thought of that! Here are two other ways to accomplish it; you might have come up with something yet different that also works fine.\n\n```html\n<$set name=formattedToday value=<<now \"0MM/0DD\">>>\n  It's ''<$text text={{{ [[UsHolidays]getindex<formattedToday>] }}} />'' today!\n</$set>\n```\n\n(Recall that the `text` widget is needed to prevent the holiday from turning into a link with the use of triple curly braces.)\n\n\n```html\n\\define holidayTransclusion()\n  {{UsHolidays##$(formattedToday)$}}\n\\end\n\n<$set name=formattedToday value=<<now \"0MM/0DD\">>>\n  It's ''<<holidayTransclusion>>'' today!\n</$set>\n```"
