Further, HTML doesn't generally call them \u201cmodes\u201d -- you're more likely to see \u201clayouts\u201d or \u201ccontexts\u201d depending on exactly what is being discussed. But as we'll see, this is convenient terminology to use with TiddlyWiki because the wikitext parser actually does have \u201cmodes,\u201d so it will be good enough for this discussion."),
