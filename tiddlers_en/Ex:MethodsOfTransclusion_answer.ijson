  "text": "This one's fun because TiddlyWiki gives you so many different ways to skin this cat. Here's perhaps the most obvious one:\n\n```html\n<$set name=currentTiddler value=JaneDoe>\n\n  {{!!text}}\n\n</$set>\n```\n\nYou may have noticed that you had to put the blank lines before and after `{{!!text}}` or the formatting ended up all funny. Back in the section on [[dynamic lists|Your First Dynamic List]], we noted that there are cases where whitespace does matter with widgets and HTML. This is one of them, and it's due to a distinction in TiddlyWiki and HTML between //block mode// and //inline mode//. We'll [[talk more about these modes later|Block Mode and Inline Mode]] -- for now, just remember that if everything gets all squashed up in one line, you're probably stuck in inline mode, and you can get out of it by putting a blank line before and after the thing that's getting squashed.\n\nHere are several more possibilities:\n\n```html\n<$list filter=\"[[JaneDoe]]\">\n\n  {{!!text}}\n\n</$list>\n```\n\n```html\n\\define janedoe(janesName)\n  {{$janesName$}}\n\\end\n\n<<janedoe JaneDoe>>\n```\n\n```html\n<$list filter=\"[[JaneDoe]get[text]]\">\n\n  <<currentTiddler>>\n\n</$list>\n```\n\nAnother way would be to create another tiddler, call it `JaneDoeStandin`, put `{{JaneDoe}}` in //that// tiddler, and then transclude `{{JaneDoeStandin}}`.\n\n`{{JaneDoe!!text}}` is technically not writing `{{JaneDoe}}`, though this solution seems a bit cheap!\n\nSimilarly but a little bit more cleverly, `{{JaneDoe||JaneDoe}}` (transclude the tiddler `JaneDoe` with the current tiddler as `JaneDoe`) means the same thing as `{{JaneDoe}}`. (`{{||JaneDoe}}` won't work, though, because that makes the current tiddler `JaneTransclusion`, and the `ContactInformationTemplate` transcluded within `JaneDoe` depends on the current tiddler being `JaneDoe`.)\n\nHere are two other ways that use widgets we haven't seen yet:\n\n```html\n<$let currentTiddler=JaneDoe>\n\n  {{!!text}}\n\n</$let>\n```\n\n```html\n<$transclude tiddler=JaneDoe mode=block />\n```\n\nIf you get bored, see how many other options you can come up with! I'm not at the end of my own ideas by any means.\n",
