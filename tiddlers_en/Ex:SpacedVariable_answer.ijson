  "text": "It becomes impossible to reference (if you write `<<some variable>>`, nothing will appear). This is because words after the first space in the angle brackets are treated as //parameters// rather than as part of the name of the variable. This will make sense in a moment when we talk about [[Macros]].\n\nYou might wonder if you could say `<<\"the eis\">>` to refer to a variable name containing a space, by analogy to the way you can include multiple words in the value of an [[HTML attribute|HTML]], but this isn't valid syntax."
