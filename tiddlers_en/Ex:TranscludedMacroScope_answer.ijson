  "text": _("To test this, you could place a macro in a tiddler, transclude that macro in another tiddler, and see if you can call the macro. If you do this, you'll find that your `<<macro call>>` doesn't produce any output, which is what happens when the macro is not defined (we saw this in an [[earlier exercise|Ex:MacroPosition]]).\n\nWe can conclude from this experiment that the macro goes out of scope at the end of the transclusion. It makes no difference whether the tiddler containing the macro was transcluded via a template or not.\n\nThere are ways we can make macros available in other tiddlers, but transcluding the tiddler containing the macros is not one of them."),
