  "text": "If you've made it this far in //Grok TiddlyWiki// and expect to continue using and enjoying TiddlyWiki, please consider contributing financially to or helping out with the GTW and/or TiddlyWiki projects. Such open-source projects thrive when a wide variety of people get involved. Here are some options.\n\nFor GTW:\n\n* ''<a href={{$:/sib/DonationLink}}>Donate to the Grok TiddlyWiki project</a>'' to support me in keeping this book up to date.\n* ''Provide feedback on the book''. In addition to using the //send feedback// link at the bottom of any section to provide targeted feedback on that section, you can send general thoughts on how well the book has worked for you to `contact@sorenbjornstad.com`.\n\nFor TiddlyWiki itself:\n\n* ''Become a contributor to the TiddlyWiki organization'' or fund an ongoing project [[on OpenCollective|https://opencollective.com/tiddlywikidotorg]]. Such contributions help keep the project running smoothly, and they also give you a small stake in the community (if you fund a feature, for instance, your take on that feature will be prioritized).\n* ''Share your new expertise'' on the [[TiddlyWiki forums|https://groups.google.com/g/tiddlywiki]].\n* ''Share TiddlyWiki tools you create as plugins'' (see [[Creating Plugins]]) or, if you know some JavaScript, [[help out with the core development of TiddlyWiki|https://github.com/Jermolene/TiddlyWiki5]].\n* ''Share TiddlyWiki with your friends''. The more users we have, the stronger and healthier the community."
