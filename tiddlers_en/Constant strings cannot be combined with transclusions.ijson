  "text": _("Often we need to build a string of text out of several components, such as [[variables|Variables]], constant strings (text that doesn't change), [[tiddler fields|Transclusions]], or [[filter expressions|Filters and Transclusions]]. It's tempting to simply place the references next to each other, like `<<variable>>constant{{!!field}}`, but this does not always work correctly, because in many contexts TiddlyWiki requires just //one// of these items, not several in a row.\n\n\n!! Example of the mistake\n\n<<<\nI want to add a template to the [[view template|The View Template]] which displays an image associated with each tiddler tagged \u201cArtwork\u201d. The image name is the name of the tiddler plus `.png`. I've tried a number of ways to write this without success.\n\n{{Sn:BadImageTransclusions||MagicSnippet}}\n\nI'm at my wits' end here. What does TiddlyWiki want from me?\n<<<\n\n!! Explanation\n\nExamples 1--3 above are syntax errors because ''you cannot use transclusions'' (`<<variable>>`, `<<macro>>`, `{{field}}`, or `{{{ filter }}}`) ''inside other links or transclusions''. As a rule of thumb, if you're putting brackets inside other brackets with a different shape and you aren't writing a [[filter|Filters]], you're probably committing a syntax error.\n\nExamples 4 and 6 are also syntax errors because ''you cannot combine a transclusion with a constant string'' within an HTML attribute. You have to pick //either// one transclusion //or// one constant string. To put it more broadly, the value of an HTML or widget attribute like `src` can be exactly one of four things: a \"constant string in quotation marks\" that never changes, or a transclusion of a `{{{ filter result }}}`, `{{tiddler field}}`, or `<<macro call/variable reference>>` \u2013 but never a combination of two or more of those things. (See [[Summary of Macro and Transclusion Syntax]] for more on these kinds of transclusion.)\n\nExamples 5 and 7 are valid syntax but ''don't do what you want''. The \"double quotation marks\" make the entire value of the `source` or `src` attribute a constant string -- that is, TiddlyWiki doesn't look inside for [[wikitext|Wikitext]] and [[wikify|Wikification]] it, it just passes the text on to the `$image` widget or `img` tag. As a result, what you're asking TiddlyWiki to do is display an image with the literal title `{{!!title}}.png`.\n\nTo make things a little more complicated, this //does// work even though what you just learned might suggest it wouldn't:\n\n{{Sn:ImageTransclusionName||MagicSnippet}}\n\nThis example differs from the previous ones in that (a) the quotation marks here don't indicate a constant string because they're not used as the value of an HTML or widget attribute -- they're just more characters of text to TiddlyWiki here -- and (b) TiddlyWiki wikifies anything that ends up directly within the body of a tiddler (rather than in an attribute), including `{{!!field transclusions}}`.\n\n\n!! Solutions\n\nThere are {{Ltc:TwoWaysToConcatenate||LieToChildrenTemplate}} to //concatenate// (smash together) text that needs to be used elsewhere in wikitext or as the value of an attribute: with a ''filter expression'', or with a ''macro, using text substitution''.\n\n!!! With a filter expression\n\nThe filter expression is easier to understand and has fewer gotchas, so let's start with that. We use the `addsuffix` [[filter operator|Anatomy of Filter Steps]] to add more text to the end of an existing input tiddler (or `addprefix` to add it to the beginning):\n\n{{Sn:GoodImageTransclusionFilter||MagicSnippet}}\n\nIn this particular filter expression, we start with the title of the current tiddler, then add a constant suffix to it. The `{{{ triple braces }}}` transclude the result of the filter expression directly into a tiddler. We can use constant strings, variables, or fields for any component of the filter, and add as many `suffix`es or `prefix`es as we need, so we could say for example:\n\n{{Sn:StringConcatenationWithFilters||MagicSnippet}}\n\nThis approach is still a transclusion, we're just simplifying it to a //single// transclusion rather than several pieces in a row. So it only works with text that's bound for the body of a tiddler or for an HTML tag or widget attribute; it still doesn't work within things like `[[wikitext links]]`. This isn't a big deal because [[there is an associated HTML or widget form for every feature of wikitext|Widgets]], but if you want to use the wikitext form, you might prefer the macro method.\n\n\n!!! With a macro\n\nTo use a macro, we place the concatenation inside a [[macro|Macros]], performing [[text substitution|Text Substitution]] with $dollar signs$ on the part that changes. Then we call the macro as the value of our `source` attribute:\n\n{{Sn:GoodImageTransclusionMacro||MagicSnippet}}\n\nOr, if we prefer, since we're using text substitution, we can even use the wikitext syntax:\n\n{{Sn:GoodImageTransclusionMacroWikitext||MagicSnippet}}\n\nIf you aren't sure why this works better than the wrong examples, read the [[Text Substitution]] section for an explanation.\n\nNotice that we directly substituted a variable into the macro with the `$(parenthesized)$` syntax, rather than passing the tiddler title as a parameter and using the `$parameter$` syntax. This is because using the result of a macro call inside a macro call, like this, isn't valid syntax:\n\n```html\n<$image source=<<myImageFilename <<currentTiddler>>>>/>\n```\n\nAs a result, we actually //can't// pass `<<currentTiddler>>` in as a parameter; this is an irritating limitation, but for now it's how TiddlyWiki works. See [[Filters and Transclusions]] and [[Using Variables in Macros]] for more on this situation.\n\n(You can put `<<currentTiddler>>` in quotation marks to make the syntax valid, but then you're just passing the string `<<currentTiddler>>` rather than the name of the current tiddler to the macro, which isn't very helpful.)")
