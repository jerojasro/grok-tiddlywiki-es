  "text": _("Here's a simple version that just shows the phone number:\n\n```html\nView phone number for family member: <$list filter={{!!family}}><$radio tiddler=<<qualify \"$:/temp/FamilyContact\">> value=<<currentTiddler>>>&nbsp;<<currentTiddler>></$radio>&ensp;</$list>\n\n<$set name=\"stateTiddlerName\" value=<<qualify \"$:/temp/FamilyContact\">>>\n\t<$transclude tiddler={{{ [<stateTiddlerName>get[text]] }}} field=\"phone\"/>\n</$set>\n```\n\nNotice that we don't transclude the tiddler `$:/temp/FamilyContact` itself, like `<$transclude tiddler=\"$:/temp/FamilyContact\"/>`, we transclude //the transcluded value of// `$:/temp/FamilyContact` (using the filter `[<stateTiddlerName>get[text]]`). You might have to think about this for a moment: we stored the name of the selected contact in the tiddler `$:/temp/FamilyContact`, so we don't want to transclude the tiddler `$:/temp/FamilyContact` -- we would be trying to get the value of the `phone` field of `$:/temp/FamilyContact` itself (which it presumably does not have). Instead, we want to transclude the `phone` field of the tiddler which is named within that tiddler (i.e., the contact tiddler we selected). This means we effectively have to transclude twice.")
