  "text": _("You get links that look like this:\n\n{{Sn:QuotedMacroExpansion||MagicSnippet}}\n\nIn other words, TiddlyWiki did not expand the macro.\n\nPutting quotation marks around a macro call or variable reference passed to an HTML attribute makes it //literal// -- that is, TiddlyWiki doesn't try to look at it to see if it's a variable or macro call. This is very occasionally what you want, but usually it's a mistake.\n\nThe quotation marks should be omitted even if the macro call has spaces in it. So for some made-up macro `mymacro` with two parameters, this would the correct way to call it, even though it may look wrong at first glance:\n\n```html\n<$macrocall $name=\"wikipediaLink\" linktext=<<mymacro attribute1 \"attribute two\">> articleName=Dingo/>\n```\n"),
