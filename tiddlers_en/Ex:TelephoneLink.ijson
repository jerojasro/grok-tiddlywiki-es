  "text": _("Suppose we want to create a link for a contact which, when clicked on a smartphone, calls the contact. This can be accomplished with a link to a URL like `tel:888-555-1234`. Create such a link and add it to the `ContactInformationTemplate`.\n\nIf you want to use a `[[double square brackets]]` link rather than an `a` HTML element, you need to use `ext`, like this:\n\n```html\n[ext[tel:888-555-1234]]\n```\n\nThat's because `tel:888-555-1234` by itself would be a valid name for a tiddler, too, so if TiddlyWiki isn't told it's an external link, it will assume it's an internal one. See the //External Links// heading [[here in the TiddlyWiki documentation |https://tiddlywiki.com/#Linking%20in%20WikiText]] for more information.")
