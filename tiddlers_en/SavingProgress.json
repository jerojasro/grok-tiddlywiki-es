See the [[copyright notice|Copyright]] for details.\n\nSince the point of having your own copy is being able to edit the wiki to save your progress, you'll also need a way to save changes to the file. The most convenient way is to [[load the file up in TiddlyDesktop|Installing TiddlyWiki]], just like the wiki you'll be doing exercises in. Once you've done that, close out of //Grok TiddlyWiki// in your web browser and pick up where you left off in TiddlyDesktop (you can use the //Outline// link in the upper-right to quickly find your spot again). In the future, open the book in TiddlyDesktop rather than on the web.\n\nBe sure to save your changes when you close the book for a while; TiddlyDesktop will prompt you to do so when you close the window.",
