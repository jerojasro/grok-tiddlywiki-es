  "text": "{{Sn:WikitextHeadings||MagicSnippet}}\n\nHeadings should be used sparingly in TiddlyWiki. If you find yourself creating complex multi-level headings within a tiddler, you [[should probably be creating multiple tiddlers|Slicing Up Content]] instead.\n\nHeading 1 is usually not used (in HTML documents, it is reserved for the page title).\n\nAnything below Heading 4 is smaller than the body text and not particularly useful. If you find yourself needing anything deeper than Heading 3, you should //definitely// be splitting out into multiple tiddlers anyway. I typically try to avoid more than one level of headings within an individual tiddler.\n\nHeadings are [[block-level elements|Block Mode and Inline Mode]], so you need to put a blank line between text and a following heading, or the heading will get rolled into the preceding paragraph, which is almost certainly not what you want:\n\n{{Sn:WikitextHeadingsRolledIn||MagicSnippet}}",
