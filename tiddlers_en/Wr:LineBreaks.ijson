While usually helpful, this can be unwanted in a few circumstances, like when trying to display poetry. You can turn off this behavior for a block of text by wrapping it in triple quotes:\n\n{{Sn:WikitextTripleQuotes||MagicSnippet}}\n\nWhen displaying passages this way, you might also want to put the text in a block quote or indent some lines. You can combine this with the block-quote syntax, and use HTML //em spaces// (`&emsp;`) to add a small indent:\n\n{{Sn:WikitextPoetryMarkup||MagicSnippet}}\n"),
