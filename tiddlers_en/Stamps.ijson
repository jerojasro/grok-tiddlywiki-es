  "text": "''Stamps'' are snippets of text that can be inserted into a tiddler at the click of a button, for use when a macro or transclusion wouldn't be feasible or appropriate. For instance, perhaps what you need to insert is actually a macro call, but one that has a bunch of parameters which you can't remember well.\n\nStamps are tiddlers (what else?) tagged `$:/tags/TextEditor/Snippet`. Such tiddlers appear on the <<textual-button \"stamp\">> stamp button on the edit toolbar under the name in their `caption` field, and clicking them inserts the text of the relevant snippet into the editor.\n\nIt's also possible to make a stamp take some selected text and add a prefix or suffix to it, rather than just inserting a chunk of new text. For this and more, see the [[documentation on stamps|https://tiddlywiki.com/#Using%20Stamp]].\n\n{{Ex:WikipediaLinkSnippet||ExerciseTemplate}}\n\n!! Takeaways\n\n{{||TakeawaysTemplate}}"
