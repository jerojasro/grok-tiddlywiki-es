  "text": "Generally, this works the way you would hope -- first TiddlyWiki renders the \u201cfurthest down\u201d tiddler, then it moves one level up and includes that content in that tiddler, and so on until it comes to the \u201ctop-level\u201d transclusion.\n\nThere are some edge cases, which mostly involve the complexities of TiddlyWiki's concept of the //current tiddler//. We'll talk about the current tiddler in the [[next section|Templates and the Current Tiddler]]."
