Here are some interesting TiddlyWikis:\n\n* [[My Zettelkasten|https://zettelkasten.sorenbjornstad.com]]:  shameless self-promotion, but it should be a nice complement to this book. I have several other wikis, but this is my largest public TiddlyWiki and where I do a lot of my TiddlyWiki-assisted thinking.\n* [[Interactive Historical Atlas of the Disciplines|http://atlas-disciplines.unige.ch]], a beautiful catalog of the branches of science over time.\n* The [[Community page|https://tiddlywiki.com#Community]] on tiddlywiki.com lists a number of wikis.\n\nIf you have a public TiddlyWiki you'd like to see on this list, click the //send feedback// link below and send over a URL and description.\n\nThe [[TiddlyWiki Links Aggregator|https://links.tiddlywiki.com]] is still in the early stages of development, but promises to be a valuable resource for finding examples. Right now you should be able to find some under the [[Examples|https://links.tiddlywiki.com/topics/examples/]] tag, but this is subject to change."),
