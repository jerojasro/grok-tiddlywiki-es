  "text": "It's frequently useful to add content or navigational functions to the sidebar. In particular, there are several types of custom navigation that would be immediately helpful for our office-notes wiki:\n\n* There is currently no easy way to order and ''look at journal tiddlers by date'', something which will likely be a common task.\n* Similarly, ''listing our meetings by date'' would be helpful. We already have a `MeetingList`, but right now we have to remember that it exists and search for it.\n* We might like a ''hierarchical view of our projects'', or at least a list of them, in the sidebar so we can quickly navigate through them.\n\nLet's create a new tab in the sidebar called `Views` to store custom ways of looking at some of our tiddlers. Within the `Views` tab, we'll add some vertical tabs, just like the default `More` tab does, for `Journal`, `Meetings`, and `Projects`.\n\nThe first step is to ''create a tiddler for each inner tab''. As noted earlier, we already have a tiddler that can serve as the meeting list, `MeetingList`; you may, however, want to clean out some extra crud that we have added to it in previous exercises, so that it just shows a simple list of meetings. For the journal list, clone the meeting list and tweak the filter so that it selects tiddlers with the `Journal` tag instead of the `Meeting` tag. \n\nFor the project list, let's look at a slightly different method. All of our tiddlers are tagged `Project`, so why not just make `Project` -- the tagging tiddler -- into the list? This fits perfectly with the standard dual function of tags in TiddlyWiki as both tiddlers (units of content) and a mechanism for building structure. Go ahead and edit this tiddler, or create it if it doesn't exist in your wiki, and add an appropriate TOC macro to it. (Have a look at [[Creating Hierarchies with a Table of Contents]] if you've forgotten how.)\n\nThe next step is to create a tiddler that ''combines those inner tabs into a single tiddler''. Let's call this tiddler `$:/yourname/Views`. We'll set things up so that we can add new tabs by simply tagging the tab tiddler `$:/yourname/Views`:\n\n```html\n<<tabs\n  tabsList:\"[tag[$:/yourname/Views]]\"\n  default:\"JournalList\"\n  class:\"tc-vertical\">>\n```\n\nGo back and tag each of the inner-tab tiddlers with `$:/yourname/Views`. You should immediately see tabs appear for them within the `$:/yourname/Views` tiddler.\n\nThe last step is to make the Views tiddler itself show up as a new tab on the sidebar. This is left as an exercise.\n\n\n!! Exercises\n\n{{Ex:ViewsOnSidebar||ExerciseTemplate}}\n{{Ex:FriendlyViewsNames||ExerciseTemplate}}\n{{Ex:SidebarCurrentTiddler||ExerciseTemplate}}\n\n\n!!
