  "text": "//StretchText//, generally attributed to [[Ted Nelson|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Nelson]], is a form of hypertext in which links, or summary snippets, can be expanded in place: in other words, you can \u201cstretch\u201d parts of the text that you want to see in more detail to zoom in on them. Implement stretch-text in TiddlyWiki using a template or macro that allows you to expand and contract a tiddler serving as the \u201cnext level down\u201d.\n\nYou can find an example and a TiddlyWiki implementation as the TiddlyStretch plugin in my [[list of cynical laws|https://zettelkasten.sorenbjornstad.com/#LawOfCynicism]] in my Zettelkasten."
