  "text": "You can create both internal and external [[links|Links]] using the `[[double bracket]]` syntax. Internal links go to another tiddler, while external links go to a URL; TiddlyWiki automatically selects the correct type based on the link target. To make the link text different than the target, you place the link text first, followed by a pipe (`|`) character and then the link target.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\n{{Sn:WikitextLinksExample||MagicSnippet}}\n\nURLs or paths to files are automatically linked if they appear in the text of your tiddler. However, there are a handful of cases where TiddlyWiki can't automatically detect something as a URL, for instance if it's a relative path to a file on your computer (see [[Images and Attachments]]) for why you might want that. Then placing the path by itself will make it normal text, and putting it in double square brackets will try to link to a tiddler with that name. In this case, you can use the `ext` syntax to force an external link.\n\n{{Sn:WikitextExtForce||MagicSnippet}}\n\nIf CamelCase links are on in the control panel, words in CamelCase are automatically turned into links. If you want to prevent a CamelCase word from turning into a link, precede it with a tilde: `~CamelCase` (note that the tilde will appear literally in the output if you have camel-case linking off, though). See the [[CamelCase appendix|CamelCase]] for details.",
