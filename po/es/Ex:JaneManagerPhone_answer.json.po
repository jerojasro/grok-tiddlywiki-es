msgid "If you need a refresher, TiddlyWiki processes the contents of transclusions (of variables and macros, as we saw before, as well as of fields) separately from the surrounding content, so the result of `{{!!manager}}` (namely, `ChrisSmith`) is an entirely separate piece of wikitext to TiddlyWiki. Thus, what it would see would be three separate, unconnected pieces: `{{`, `ChrisSmith`, and `!!phone }}`."
