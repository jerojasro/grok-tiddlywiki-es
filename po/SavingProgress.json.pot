msgid "Since the point of having your own copy is being able to edit the wiki to save your progress, you'll also need a way to save changes to the file. The most convenient way is to [[load the file up in TiddlyDesktop|Installing TiddlyWiki]], just like the wiki you'll be doing exercises in. Once you've done that, close out of //Grok TiddlyWiki// in your web browser and pick up where you left off in TiddlyDesktop (you can use the //Outline// link in the upper-right to quickly find your spot again). In the future, open the book in TiddlyDesktop rather than on the web."
