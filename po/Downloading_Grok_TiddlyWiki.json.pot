msgid "//Grok TiddlyWiki// is a TiddlyWiki itself, as you may have noticed or suspected by now. To get the full value out of GTW, you'll want to create your own copy of this wiki; this will allow GTW to save information about your progress and personalize the book for you. If you don't create a copy, you won't be able to keep track of which exercises you've completed, review takeaways, create bookmarks, or save your place when you stop reading."
